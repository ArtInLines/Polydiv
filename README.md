# Polydiv

The initial reason for this project was to calculate polynomial divisions in certain fields of characteristic 2.

I extended that idea ever more while working on it and by now the project supports all common arithmetic operations on polynomials of any type, as long as said type implements the Field trait.

Plans already exist to extend this codebase to allow evaluating arithmetic expressions of any algebraic objects (e.g. groups, rings).
